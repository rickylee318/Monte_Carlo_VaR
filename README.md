# Monte_Carlo_VaR

### Motivation

- Typically, there are three major ways to measure value at risk, includingparameteric, variance-covariance and monte carlo approaches.  In montecarlo apporach, it simluate the loss of portfolio with changes in portfoliorisks.

- However, the computation of simulation usually cost enormous becausethe VaR often happens in rare events, causing waste of time andcomputation.  Under this circumstance, importance sampling is used to
